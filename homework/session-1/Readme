## Homework for session 1

Challenge 1: Create a number guessing game. The computer should pick a random number between 1 and 100. The user should be prompted to guess the number. If the user guesses incorrectly, the computer should tell them whether they guessed too high or too low. If the user guesses correctly, the computer should congratulate them. The user should be able to keep guessing until they get the right answer.

Challenge 2: Create a program that will calculate the tip to leave at a restaurant. Prompt the user for two things: the total bill amount and the percentage to tip. Print out the resulting tip amount and total bill with tip included.
