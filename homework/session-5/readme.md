# Homework Assignment - Data Analysis and GitHub Integration

## Task 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Create a new GitHub repository under the organization (Recover-VA-Learning)[https://github.com/Recover-VA-Learning] named "[your Name]_Data_Analysis".
- you should have permissions, if not let me know and I can fix that.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.

## Task 2: Data Analysis

1. Download any dataset of your choice (e.g., CSV, Excel, JSON) that contains some data you want to analyze (NO PHI OR PII).
2. Use the pandas library to load the dataset into a DataFrame.
3. Perform some basic data analysis tasks on the DataFrame, such as:
   - Displaying the first few rows of the dataset.
   - Calculating summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) for numeric columns.
   - Counting the number of unique values in a column.
   - Filtering the dataset based on certain conditions.
4. Generate visualizations of the data using matplotlib or ployly libraries.
   - Plot a histogram of a numeric column.
   - Create a scatter plot of two numeric columns.
   - Plot a bar chart of categorical data.

## Task 3: Push Code to GitHub

1. Create the python files, either notebook or python files or both.
2. Write the code for data analysis tasks in the files.
3. Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository.

## Task 4: Next week we will pull the code and review it together.
