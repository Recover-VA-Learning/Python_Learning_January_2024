# Homework Assignment - OOP

## Task 1: Student Class Creation

1. Define a class named `Student`.
2. The `__init__` method should initialize the following attributes:
   - `name` (string): representing the student's name.
   - `class_name` (string): representing the student's class.
   - `grades` (list): representing the student's grades.
3. Implement a method named `add_grade` that takes a grade (integer) as a parameter and appends it to the `grades` list.
4. Implement a method named `average_grade` that calculates and returns the average grade of the student.

## Task 2: Student Management System

1. Create a new Python class named `StudentManagementSystem`.
2. Inside this class, maintain a list of `Student` objects to represent multiple students.
3. Implement a method named `add_student` that takes student information (name, class, grades) as parameters and creates a new `Student` object with that information. Add this object to the list of students.
4. Implement a method named `get_student_by_name` that takes a student's name as a parameter and returns the `Student` object with that name, if it exists. If not, return an appropriate message.
5. Implement a method named `average_grade_by_class` that takes a class name as a parameter and calculates and returns the average grade for all students in that class.

## Task 3: Push Code to GitHub

1. Create the python files, either notebook or python files or both.
2. Write the code for data analysis tasks in the files.
3. Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository.

## Task 4: Next week we will pull the code and review it together.
