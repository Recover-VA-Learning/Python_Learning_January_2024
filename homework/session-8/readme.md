# Homework Assignment - Advanced Lists

## Task 1: Tokenize input

Write a Python program to implement a simple text processing tool using list comprehension and slicing. Your program should take a sentence as input and perform the following tasks:

1. Get an input from the user, either with input, command line, or file
2. Convert the sentence to lowercase.
3. Remove any punctuation marks (e.g., '.', ',', '?', '!').
4. Split the sentence into words.
5. Create a list of unique words in the sentence.

Example:
> If the input sentence is: "Hello, World! How are you doing?"
The output should be: ['hello', 'world', 'how', 'are', 'you', 'doing']

## Task 2: Linked List Music Playlist

Write a Python program to implement a simple music playlist using linked lists.

1. Implement a Song class to represent individual songs in the playlist. Each song should have attributes for title, artist, and duration.
2. Implement a Node class to represent nodes in the linked list. Each node should contain a Song object and a reference to the next node in the list.
3. Implement a Playlist class to manage the music playlist. This class should include methods to:
    - Add a song to the playlist.
    - Remove a song from the playlist.
    - Display the entire playlist.
    - Shuffle the playlist (optional).

## Task 3: Push Code to GitHub

1. Create the python files, either notebook or python files or both.
2. Write the code for data analysis tasks in the files.
3. Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository.
